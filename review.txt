General thoughts:
- A lack of comments - a very bad idea for a project that will expand and evolve
- Exception handler needs to be properly set up for API
- There's a need to clean up the project - remove unnecessary and unused filed, lines from config files and classes
- Overall it's not bad, but requires some refactoring and code optimization
